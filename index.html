I'm a full-stack developer at KnowMoreIT. Currently studying Computer Systems and Networking Technology, Computer Coding, and Computer Information Systems, I plan to obtain a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and a Master's in Computer Science. My passions include coding, ethical hacking, 3D animation in Blender, gaming, and reading. I specialize in Python, with some experience in CSHTML and C#, as well as ASP.NET Core and SQL servers. Ultimately, my goal is to work for the CIA and become an independent cybersecurity consultant. At just 17 years old, I have already completed a year of college, including five semesters in a Cisco Networking class. Let's connect and create something amazing!"/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/><meta property="twitter:image" content="/social-image.png"/><meta property="og:image" content="/social-image.png"/><title>Ethen Dixon</title><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.8e6946b9.js"></script><link href="/static/css/main.778eeed7.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
